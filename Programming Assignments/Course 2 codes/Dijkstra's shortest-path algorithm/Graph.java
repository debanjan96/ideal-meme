/**
 * Assignment:
 * The file contains an adjacency list representation of an undirected weighted 
 * graph with 200 vertices labeled 1 to 200. Each row consists of the node 
 * tuples that are adjacent to that particular vertex along with the length of 
 * that edge. For example, the 6th row has 6 as the first entry indicating that 
 * this row corresponds to the vertex labeled 6. The next entry of this row 
 * "141,8200" indicates that there is an edge between vertex 6 and vertex 141 
 * that has length 8200. The rest of the pairs of this row indicate the other 
 * vertices adjacent to vertex 6 and the lengths of the corresponding edges.
 * 
 * Task:
 * Run Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm on this graph, using 1 (the first 
 * vertex) as the source vertex, and to compute the shortest-path distances 
 * between 1 and every other vertex of the graph. If there is no path between a 
 * vertex v and vertex 1, we'll define the shortest-path distance between 1 and 
 * v to be 1000000.
 * 
 * Output format:
 * Report the shortest-path distances to the following ten vertices, in order: 
 * 7,37,59,82,99,115,133,165,188,197. You should encode the distances as a 
 * comma-separated string of integers. So if you find that all ten of these 
 * vertices except 115 are at distance 1000 away from vertex 1 and 115 is 2000 
 * distance away, then your answer should be 1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,2000,1000,
 * 1000,1000,1000. 
 *
 * Time complexity: O(n m) - In the "heap" directory, there is an optimized 
 * O(m log(n)) algorithm.
