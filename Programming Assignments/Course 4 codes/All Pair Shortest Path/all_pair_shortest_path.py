Programming Assignment (Course 4, Week 1)
The first line indicates the number of vertices and edges, respectively. 

 Each subsequent line describes an edge (the first two numbers are its tail and head, respectively) 
 1 14 6 represent an edge from 1 to 14 with length 6
 tail:1, head:14 weight:6
 and its length (the third number). NOTE: some of the edge lengths are
 negative.NOTE: These graphs may or may not have negative-cost cycles.

Your task is to compute the "shortest shortest path". 
Precisely, you must first identify which, if any, of the three graphs have no negative cycles.
